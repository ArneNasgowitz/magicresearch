        For the next minute, we would like you to write a short essay about <strong>a typical day in your life</strong>.
        Write for example about your routines, where you spend most time, who you talk to.
        If you have time left before the minute is over, please continue writing about the same topic,
        even if you feel like youâ€™re repeating yourself.
        The task will start when you click the button and then
        end automatically after <strong>90 seconds</strong>.
    </p>
