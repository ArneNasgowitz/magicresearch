        You now start the effort task. As before, please count the number of 0s and enter
        the correct number in the blank space below.
        You will have <strong>45 seconds</strong> to solve as many boxes as you can.
        Please keep in mind that the more boxes you complete correctly,
        the higher your initial payment will be.

        Also remember that in the training round you put your performance as the
        <strong>{{ player.guess }}-best </strong> on a scale from 1 to 10.
